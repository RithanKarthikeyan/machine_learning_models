## 🔍 Overview

This project is an **Email Spam Detection system** that uses a **Machine Learning model** to classify emails as **Spam** or **Safe**, and integrates the model into a **Chrome Extension** for real-time usage.

Simply activate the extension, open an email, and get instant spam detection results 🚀

## 🧠 How It Works

🟢 The **ML model** is trained using labeled email data  
🟢 Text features are extracted and classified using **scikit-learn**  
🟢 The trained model is connected to a **Chrome Extension**  
🟢 When an email is opened, the extension predicts:
- ✅ Safe  
- 🚫 Spam
